All bags are compatible with Magic Storage (Requires Magic Storage's Environmental Simulator)

	Ammo Bag - Ammo
	Builders Box - Building Blocks
	Herb Satchel - Seeds/Plants

	These bags automatically pick up items if vacuum is toggled on if the item is allowed in the bag.

	These bags automatically pick up items if vacuum is toggled on if there is an item of the same type already in the bag.

**Attention Modders**
This mod is built like an example mod to show off how to create a bag with androLib.
This mod shows how to use androLib as a hard dependency.  If you prefer a soft dependency or want better comments for a tutorial, look at Vacuum Ore Bag mod instead.
See androLib for more information on how to create your own bags:
