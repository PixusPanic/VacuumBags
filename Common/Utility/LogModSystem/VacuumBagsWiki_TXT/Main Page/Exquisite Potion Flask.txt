If any food items in the bag are favorited, only favorited food items will be used.<br/>Quick Buff will use favorited potions from the bag.<br/>Quick Heal will use healing items from the bag.  If any healing items in the bag are favorited, only favorited healing items will be used.<br/>Quick Mana will use mana items from the bag.  If any mana items in the bag are favorited, only favorited mana items will be used.<br/>Potion buffs can be paused by right clicking on the buff like you normally would to remove it or unfavoriting the potion.<br/>Potions providing a buff will have a green background.  Paused potions will have a yellow background.<br/>Paused buffs can be resumed with quick buff or by favoriting the potion in the flask.<br/>Potion effects are kept on death at the same duration they were before dying.<br/>Gaining a potion buff while you already have the buff will add their durations together instead of setting it to the new effect's duration.<br/>Removing a buff with the Shift key held will delete the buff instead of pausing it.<br/><br/>Potions will last twice as long as normal by continuously adding to the time remaining so that only 1 second is used every 2 seconds.<br/>(Pairs well with the Legendary Juiced Enchantment for permanent infinite duration if that's what you want.)<br/>When potions reach 2 ticks left, they will stop counting down, giving you infinite potion duration.<br/>When you die, all potion effects that are being held at 2 ticks left will reset. (Until death do you part)'</i>
